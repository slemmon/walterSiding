# walterSiding

This repository contains a single-file, responsive website template for a siding business.

Files
- `index.html` â€” Self-contained HTML/CSS/JS single-page site. Replace copy, colors, and image placeholders with your content.

Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings on GitHub, go to Pages and set the source to the `main` (or `master`) branch and the root folder (`/`).
3. After a minute or two, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Customization tips
- Replace the placeholder SVG data-URIs in `index.html` with real image URLs or add images to the repo and point to them.
- Update phone/email/license text in the header and contact section.
- To add tracking, paste your analytics snippet into the `<head>` of `index.html`.

If you want, I can:
- Update colors and branding to match your logo.
- Add sample real photos and alt text.
- Hook up a serverless form endpoint (Netlify / Formspree) to collect leads instead of mailto.
